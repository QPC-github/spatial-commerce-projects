This is the blog of Shopify's Spatial Commerce Team.

We are a rapid prototyping crew of engineers, designers and artists focused on exploring the latest technologies in these fields:

- Spatial computing
- Augmented reality
- Virtual reality
- Artificial intelligence

We are particularly interested in how those technologies intersect with the world of commerce, and how they might reshape it in the future.

We build in the open and regularly share our work here and on [twitter](https://twitter.com/StrangeNative), so consider following us if this is of any interest to you, and reach out if you have any questions or comments. We are always happy to talk!
